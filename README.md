# Real-Time Driver Drowsiness Detection Model

## Abstract
Driver fatigue is a leading cause of road accidents. This research presents a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using deep learning, optimized for low-power embedded systems. By compressing a complex model into a lightweight version, the system achieves an 85.5% accuracy in detecting various alertness states while maintaining energy efficiency. Utilizing facial landmark tracking and the Haar-Cascade method, the approach ensures fast and accurate detection, making it ideal for real-time vehicle safety applications. The system's integration into modern vehicles promises enhanced driver fatigue management and accident prevention.
